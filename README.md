### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an **AI engineer and linguist** currently working at [**Synthflow AI**](https://www.synthflow.ai), where I help develop the many AI features underlying Synthflow's voice agents. Before joining Synthflow I was an Applied NLP Engineer at [deepset](https://www.deepset.ai), the company behind the open source [Haystack](https://www.github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) framework and the SaaS platform [deepset Cloud](https://docs.cloud.deepset.ai).

My background is as a researcher in theoretical, experimental, and mathematical linguistics, and I continue to produce linguistic research in addition to my work in AI. I completed my Ph.D. in linguistics at [Stony Brook University](https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/) in 2018, after which I spent just over three years as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Leibniz-Center for General Linguistics (ZAS)](https://leibniz-zas.de) in Berlin. If you're interested in my research, feel free to check out my [academic webpage](https://www.robertpasternak.com).

In addition to my work in AI and linguistics, I am also an avid amateur (formerly professional) singer-songwriter, composer, and pianist, as well as a diehard fan of [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/robr0brobr0brob) and American football (go Ravens!).

My pronouns are _he_/_him_.
