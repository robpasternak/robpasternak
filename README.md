### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **natural language processing (NLP) engineer** and **linguist** working as an **Applied NLP Engineer** at [**deepset**](https://www.deepset.ai), the company behind the open source NLP framework [Haystack](https://www.github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) and the NLP SaaS platform [deepset Cloud](https://docs.cloud.deepset.ai).

Before becoming an NLP engineer I was a researcher in theoretical, experimental, and mathematical linguistics. I completed my Ph.D. in linguistics at [Stony Brook University](https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/) in 2018, after which I spent just over three years as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Leibniz-Center for General Linguistics (ZAS)](https://leibniz-zas.de) in Berlin. If you're interested in my academic work, feel free to check out my [academic webpage](https://www.robertpasternak.com).

In addition to my work in NLP and linguistics, I am also an avid amateur (formerly professional) singer-songwriter, composer, and pianist, as well as a diehard fan of [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/robr0brobr0brob) and American football (go Ravens!).
