### Hi!

I'm a **linguist**, **natural language processing (NLP) engineer**, and **data scientist** working as an **Applied NLP Engineer** at [**deepset**](https://www.deepset.ai), the company behind the open source NLP framework [Haystack](https://www.github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) and the NLP SaaS platform [deepset Cloud](https://docs.cloud.deepset.ai). If you're interested in my academic work, feel free to check out my [academic webpage](https://www.robertpasternak.com).

In addition to my work in NLP and linguistics, I am also an avid amateur (formerly professional) singer-songwriter, composer, and pianist, as well as a diehard fan of chess and American football (go Ravens!).
