### Hi there!

I am a **linguist** and **data scientist** in the process of transitioning from academia to industry.

As a linguist, my research focuses on natural language **semantics** (_How does the structure of a phrase or sentence affect its meaning?_) and **pragmatics** (_How does broader conversational context affect a sentence's meaning?_), with additional research interests in **syntax** (_How do words (or even parts of words) combine to make phrases and sentences?_). For more information on my research, see my [academic webpage](https://www.robertpasternak.com/).

As a data scientist I am interested in all sorts of problems, but am especially (and perhaps unsurprisingly) interested in issues related to **natural language processing (NLP)**. To see an example of my work, check out [GenreGuesser](https://www.github.com/robpasternak/GenreGuesser), an NLP project that I led as part of the graduation requirements for the Le Wagon data science bootcamp. In short, GenreGuesser is a machine learning model (together with a [user-friendly app](https://genre-guesser-app.herokuapp.com/)) that guesses the musical genre of a song based solely on its lyrics.

In addition to my work as a linguist and data scientist, I am also an avid amateur (formerly professional) singer-songwriter and pianist, as well as a diehard fan of chess and American football (go Ravens!).
